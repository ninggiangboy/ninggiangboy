## Hey there! I'm Ha Duy Khanh - ninggiangboy 🎉

### 🚀 About Me
🎨 I'm a coding wizard by night and a sleep enthusiast by day. Here's a bit more about my awesomeness:
- 🛠 Currently building `Graduation Project`, it's going to be epic!
- 🌱 Learning `Kotlin` to build `Spring Boot` application because why not?
- 🧠 Ask me about `Backend/Spring/Java`, I have all the answers (or at least a witty comment).
- 🌍 Based in Ha Noi, where the weather is always sunny with a chance of code!.
- 📫 Reach me via `haduykhanh.hs@gmail.com`, I don't bite.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him, because inclusivity rocks!
- 🎨 Fun fact: I am a fanboy of IU, you didn't see that coming, did you?
